# tricky-button
This code creates a centered animated button with five click-triggered effects (pulse, color rotation, bounce, shake, flip) and a ripple animation. It uses flexbox for centering, CSS animations for visual effects, and JavaScript to cycle through animations and generate ripples from click positions.
